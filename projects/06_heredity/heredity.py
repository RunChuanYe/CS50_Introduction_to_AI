        2. For anyone with no parents listed in the data set,
           use the probability distribution PROBS["gene"] to
           determine the probability that they have a particular number of the gene.
        3. For anyone with parents in the data set,
           each parent will pass one of their two genes on to their child randomly,
           and there is a PROBS["mutation"] chance that it mutates 
           (goes from being the gene to not being the gene, or vice versa).
        4. Use the probability distribution PROBS["trait"] (conditional)
           to compute the probability that a person does or does not have a particular trait.
        5. Recall that to compute a joint probability of multiple events,
           you can do so by multiplying those probabilities together.
           But remember that for any child, the probability 
           of them having a certain number of genes is conditional 
           on what genes their parents have.
